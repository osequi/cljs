# Structural editing

- **Structural**:

  - Clojure is a LISP and therefore the code is structural.
  - It's not lines and strings of code but structures -> data -> S-expressions (forms)
  - This implies a special structural editing and navigation (Paredit).
  - It's a complicated learning process, leave it at the end, after you'va mastered the basics.

- Arrows:

  - **Ctrl**, **Ctrl Alt** => Navigate
  - **Ctrl Shift** , **Alt Shift** => Select
  - **Ctrl Alt Shift** => Edit / Move

- Lots of other keys: https://calva.io/paredit/
- It takes time to learn them
