# Data structures

## Data types

- Primitive types: numeric, boolean, enumerations
- Composite types: array, record, union, set, object, string
- Other types: pointers, references, function, meta, utility

## Abstract Data Types (ADT)

- The mathematical model behind data types
- It defines the theory only, and later it is implemented via data structures
- ADTs:
  - Container
  - List
  - Tuple
  - Associative array, Map
  - Multimap
  - Set
  - Multiset (bag)
  - Stack
  - Queue (example Priority queue)
  - Double-ended queue
  - Graph (example Tree, Heap)

## Data structures

- Implements ADTs
- A data structure is:
  - A collection of data values
  - The relationships among them, and
  - The functions or operations that can be applied to the data
- Data structures:

  - Linear data structures
    - Arrays
    - Lists
  - Trees

    - Binary trees
    - B-trees
    - Heaps
    - Trees
    - Multi-way trees
    - pace-partitioning trees
    - Application-specific trees

  - Hash-based structures
  - Graphs
  - Other

## Algebraic Data Types

- Specific for functional programming.
- Is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.
- Two common classes of algebraic types are:
  - Product types
    - Tuples
    - Records
  - Sum types
    - Tagged, or disjoint unions
    - Variant, coproduct types
