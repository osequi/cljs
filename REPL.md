# REPLs

## Notes

- When there is an error in the code the REPL gives Syntax error on evaluation. And starts acting strange.
- Anything printed to stdout (`println`) is not shown inline

## Chlorine (for Atom)

- Harder to set up than Calva.
- It can achieve the same results: https://medium.com/@jacekschae/slick-clojure-editor-setup-with-atom-a3c1b528b722
- However it is programmable / extendable: https://youtu.be/g8dyoO-pRKQ
- Also Atom is more hackable than VSCode

## Calva (for VSCode)

- https://calva.io/getting-started/

### Commands

- `Ctrl+Alt+C Enter` -> Load file
- `Ctrl Enter` -> Eval anything (forms)
- `Alt Enter` -> Eval top level
