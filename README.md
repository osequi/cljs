### News:

## Editors

- They bundle lots of stuff like REPL, docs, code navigation, keybindings etc.
- Can't really switch between IDEs like in JS / React

### VSCode / Calva

- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva

### Atom / Chlorine

- https://atom.io/packages/chlorine
- This installs `lein` among others and a REPL
- The `lein` generated app (test1) looks very great!
- Adds different REPL keybindings than Calva.

### IntelliJ Idea / Cursive

- https://cursive-ide.com/
- Very enterprise-y
- Downloads docs, etc... Seems very pro but unusable (too heavy) for a web dev coming from Atom/VSCode

There are other simple methods to up and running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3_mrbBHGMA
