# cljs

Learning ClojureScript.

## Ecoystem

- News feed: https://bilbof.com/blogosphere/tags/clojure

## Setup

- Install: https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started

## Editors

- VSCode / Calva: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva

  - Atom / Chlorine: https://atom.io/packages/chlorine
  - This installs `lein` among others and a REPL
  - The `lein` generated app (test1) looks very great!
  - Adds different REPL keybindings than Calva.

- IntelliJ Idea / Cursive: https://cursive-ide.com/
  - Very enterprise-y
  - Downloads docs, etc... Seems very pro but unusable (too heavy) for a web dev coming from Atom/VSCode
- There are other simple methods to up and running: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3_mrbBHGMA
- Theming:
  - Borealis is a special Clojure theme. Added to VSCode ...
