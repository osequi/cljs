# cljs

Learning ClojureScript.

## Steps

1. Install: https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started
2. Editors:
   2.1 VSCode / Calva: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva
   2.2. Atom / Chlorine: https://atom.io/packages/chlorine

   - This installs `lein` among others and a REPL
   - The `lein` generated app (test1) looks very great!
   - Adds different REPL keybindings than Calva.

     2.3 IntelliJ Idea / Cursive: https://cursive-ide.com/

   - Very enterprise-y
   - Downloads docs, etc... Seems very pro but unusable (too heavy) for a web dev coming from Atom/VSCode

3. Theming:
   - Borealis is a special Clojure theme. Added to VSCode ...
